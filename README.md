- **Machine Learning Models**: Tests various predictive models, with Random Forest emerging as the top performer due to its 83% accuracy in predicting fight outcomes.
- **User Interface**: Features a user-friendly Streamlit application, allowing users to interactively select fighters and view predicted match outcomes.
Results
The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy, making it the backbone of our UFC Fight Predictor. This model's success lies in its ability to handle the complex nature of fight data and its proficiency in capturing the intricate relationships between various fighting attributes.
